    "## Multi-shot ASP solving\n",
    "\n",
    "[*Multi-shot ASP solving*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09811.pdf) refers to the process of calling the ASP solver (e.g., clingo) on an answer set program, getting an answer (an answer set, or the conclusion that there are no answer sets), and then changing some parts of the program and having the solver continue its search—not from scratch, but continuing where it had stopped (e.g., keeping the learned nogoods), and so not repeating the same search as it had done the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example using the wolf, goat & cabbage problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how this works, let's solve the [wolf, goat & cabbage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem) using multi-shot ASP solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to find the minimum number of moves to get the cabbage, the goat and the wolf safely to the other side, without anyone or anything getting eaten. If we don't know any bounds on this minimum number of moves, what we can do is first try it with 0 moves, if that doesn't work try it with 1 move, if that doesn't work try it with 2 moves, and so on, until we find the first number of moves for which there is a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do this by calling clingo from scratch for each number `t` of moves. The disadvantage is that clingo will then do a lot of extra work. For example, all the intermediate information (which combinations of atoms lead to a conflict, etc) that clingo learned in the solving process for `t` would then be thrown away, and for `t+1` clingo would have to do all this work again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead, let's use multi-shot solving, where we add new rules and facts to the program when `t` increases, allowing clingo to keep the intermediate information that it found in the previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we split our ASP program into two parts:\n",
    "- `asp_code_base`, that is independent of the time steps, and only refers to time step `t=1`;\n",
    "- `asp_code_step`, that we will use for each subsequent value of `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the 'base' part of the program is as follows. We add the facts and rules of our program that are either independent of the time steps, or refer to time step 1."
